# Overview of the Analysis:
I am working for a company that is looking toward offering retirement packages for those who meet certain criteria. The company is also trying to make decisions based on what positions are opening up. I created two technical analysis deliverables. These queries are to determine the number of retiring employees per retirement title and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. These queries will help the company in making future decisions on employment title openings, as well as program eligibility. 



# Results: 
- The company should look into hiring more senior engineers as it will be losing a noteworthy amount
- The company should also look into hiring engineers as several of them are retiring.

- Three are over 1500 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program
- Over 1200 of these employees eligible for the mentorshop program are either senior engineers, engineers, or senior staff. 



# Summary: 
As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact, there will be seven titles that will need to be filled. These titles include: 5916 Senior Engineers, 24926 Senior Staff, 9285 Engineers, 7696 Staff, 3603 Technique Leaders, 1090 Assistant Engineers and 2 Managers. 

There are currently a fair amount of qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation. These eligible mentors include: 569 Senior Staff, 501 Engineers, 169 Senior Staff, 155 Staff, 78 Assistant Engineers and 77 Technique Leaders.  

See csv "eligible_per_title" in the Data folder as well as Query "eligible_per_title" for the query and csv that show these results.
